# Seafarer: An Oceanic Exploration Adventure

## Game Concept
Seafarer is a relaxing, atmospheric exploration game set in a vast procedurally generated ocean world. Players navigate their boat across beautiful waters, discovering islands, ancient structures, and mysterious artifacts while experiencing dynamic weather and day/night cycles. The game focuses on the joy of exploration, discovery, and creating a meditative sailing experience rather than combat or traditional gameplay challenges.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Physics**: Custom wave and boat physics
- **Audio**: Web Audio API / Howler.js

## Core Mechanics

### Boat Navigation & Control
- First-person perspective from the boat
- Interactive wheel control system (press E or left-click to control)
- Realistic boat physics affected by waves and weather
- Boat responds to wave height and direction for immersive sailing
- Rudder animation that responds to turning

### Exploration Tools
- Binoculars for spotting distant landmarks and points of interest
- Compass or navigation tools to help with orientation
- Map system that fills in as you explore new areas
- Telescope for nighttime star navigation

### World Design
- Procedurally generated ocean with realistic wave patterns
- Dynamic weather system with varying storm intensities
- Day/night cycle with atmospheric lighting changes
- Distinct regions with unique visual styles (tropical waters, arctic seas, etc.)
- Islands, reefs, and landmarks visible from a distance

### Discovery Elements
- Ancient structures visible from a distance to draw player curiosity
- Hidden coves and underwater treasures
- Environmental storytelling through ruins and artifacts
- Collectible items that reveal lore about the world

### Weather & Ocean Dynamics
- Realistic wave simulation with multiple wave patterns
- Dynamic weather that affects wave height and boat handling
- Storm systems that move across the ocean
- Visual effects for different weather conditions (rain, fog, etc.)
- Time of day affects visibility and navigation challenges

### Atmosphere & Immersion
- Dynamic ambient soundtrack that responds to weather and time of day
- Realistic ocean sound effects (waves, wind, etc.)
- Minimal UI to maintain immersion
- Optional photo mode to capture beautiful ocean vistas

## Visual Style
- Low-poly aesthetic with stylized water shaders
- Atmospheric lighting with god rays and reflections
- Particle effects for sea spray, foam, and weather
- Post-processing effects (bloom, color grading) to enhance mood
- Stylized but readable distant landmarks

## Player Progression
- No traditional leveling or skill systems
- Progress measured through exploration and discovery
- Journal or logbook that fills with information about discovered locations
- Upgrades for your boat that can be found or crafted
- Unlockable viewpoints or special locations that reveal more of the map

## Technical Implementation Plan
1. Core boat physics and control system ✓
2. Wave simulation with multiple wave patterns ✓
3. Basic weather system with storm intensity ✓
4. Implement binoculars and distant landmark spotting
5. Create procedural island and landmark generation
6. Develop discovery and collection mechanics
7. Add atmospheric effects (lighting, particles, post-processing)
8. Integrate audio system with ambient music and environmental sounds
9. Implement logbook and progression tracking
10. Optimize performance for smooth experience
11. Polish UI and add quality-of-life features
