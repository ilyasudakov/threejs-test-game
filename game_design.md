# Wanderer: A Low-Poly Exploration Game

## Game Concept
Wanderer is a relaxing, atmospheric walking simulator set in a vast low-poly world. Players explore an expansive landscape, discovering ancient megastructures and mysterious artifacts while accompanied by ambient, chill music. The game focuses on exploration, discovery, and creating a meditative experience rather than traditional gameplay challenges.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Audio**: Web Audio API / Howler.js

## Core Mechanics

### Movement & Navigation
- First-person perspective
- Smooth, relaxed walking pace
- Optional sprint function with limited stamina
- Simple jump mechanics for minor obstacles
- Compass or subtle directional indicators to guide players toward points of interest

### World Design
- Procedurally generated terrain for vast explorable areas
- Level of detail (LOD) system to support huge landscapes
- Distinct biomes with unique visual styles (desert, forest, mountains, etc.)
- Day/night cycle with atmospheric lighting changes
- Weather effects (gentle rain, fog, etc.)

### Discovery Elements
- Megastructures visible from a distance to draw player curiosity
- Smaller artifacts hidden throughout the landscape
- Environmental storytelling through ruins and object placement
- Optional collectibles that reveal lore about the world

### Technical Considerations for Large-Scale World
- Chunk-based loading system to handle vast areas
- Frustum culling to only render what's in the player's view
- Instanced rendering for repeated elements (vegetation, rocks)
- Fog to limit draw distance while maintaining atmosphere
- Procedural generation with deterministic seeding for consistent world

### Atmosphere & Immersion
- Dynamic ambient soundtrack that responds to environment and discoveries
- Subtle environmental sound effects (wind, water, etc.)
- Minimal UI to maintain immersion
- Optional photo mode to capture beautiful vistas

## Visual Style
- Low-poly aesthetic with flat or simple textures
- Limited but impactful color palette for each biome
- Stylized lighting with soft shadows
- Particle effects for atmosphere (dust, pollen, etc.)
- Post-processing effects (bloom, color grading) to enhance mood

## Player Progression
- No traditional leveling or skill systems
- Progress measured through exploration and discovery
- Journal or codex that fills with information about discovered structures/artifacts
- Unlockable viewpoints or meditation spots that reveal more of the map

## Technical Implementation Plan
1. Set up basic Three.js scene with React integration
2. Implement first-person camera and movement controls
3. Create procedural terrain generation system
4. Develop chunk loading and LOD systems for vast world support
5. Design and implement megastructures and artifacts
6. Add atmospheric effects (lighting, particles, post-processing)
7. Integrate audio system with ambient music and environmental sounds
8. Implement discovery and collection mechanics
9. Optimize performance for smooth experience
10. Polish UI and add quality-of-life features
